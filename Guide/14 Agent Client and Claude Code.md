Plugin: Agent Client 0.12.1 (`agent-client`, https://github.com/RAIT-09/obsidian-agent-client, Apache 2.0, desktop only). It runs a local AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and others) over the Agent Client Protocol and puts the chat in the sidebar, in a tab, in a floating window, or inside a note.

## What it adds to Compass
- Talk to a configured agent and explicitly mention the notes you intend to share. The embedded Assistant chat uses its hosting note as context; active-note and linked-note behavior depends on client settings.
- Keep automatic approvals off. Asking before edits is a policy, not a guarantee enforced across every external client or agent.
- Prepared prompts as buttons on [[AI 助手]] and the [[Compass Dashboard]]: weekly review, retreat prep, "what matters today", writing help.
- The vault root `AGENTS.md` (pointed to by `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md`) is read at the start of each session. It tells the agent the folder map, the property conventions, and what never to touch. Edit it when you change the system. Recurring jobs are in `Prompts/` ([[20 Prompt Library]]).
- The shipped `.claude/settings.json` contains a read-only MCP allowlist. Effective permissions also depend on the client and its other settings. The optional claude-obsidian integration supplies knowledge workflows; see [[15 claude-obsidian]].
- With the Obsidian MCP bridge (see [[19 Obsidian MCP Bridge]]) the agent can open notes and boards, run any Obsidian command, search, and patch notes from inside the chat.

## Setup (once per machine)
Optional. The vault works completely without this. It needs a terminal, Node.js (https://nodejs.org, LTS), and a Claude account or API key. If you do not use a terminal, skip this page.
1. Install Claude Code and log in: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`, then run `claude` once. (An Anthropic API key stored in Obsidian's Keychain works instead; see the plugin docs.)
2. Install the adapter: `npm install -g @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp`.
3. Obsidian: Settings → Agent Client → Preset agents → Claude Code. Click **Auto-detect**, or paste the path from `which claude-agent-acp`.
4. Click the robot icon in the ribbon, send "hello". You should get a reply.

### Linux Flatpak Obsidian
The Flatpak sandbox cannot see `/usr/local/bin`, and its `PATH` is only `/usr/bin:/app/bin`, so the adapter's `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang fails. Your home directory is mounted in the sandbox, so the fix is a wrapper in `~/.local/bin`:
```sh
#!/bin/sh
exec "$HOME/.local/bin/node" "/path/to/lib/node_modules/@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp/dist/index.js" "$@"
```
Replace `/path/to/lib/node_modules/...` with the output of `npm root -g` plus `/@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp/dist/index.js`. Make the file executable (`chmod +x`) and paste its full path (for example `~/.local/bin/claude-agent-acp`, written out in full) as the Claude Code path in the plugin settings. No `flatpak override` is needed. The maintainer-documented alternative is `flatpak override --user --filesystem=host-os:ro md.obsidian.Obsidian` and pointing the plugin at `/var/run/host/usr/...`; that widens the sandbox and is not required.

To verify: open the Agent Client chat and send "hello"; a reply means the wrapper works.

## Embedding chats and buttons in notes
Fenced blocks with language `agent-client` or `agent`, body in YAML (docs: https://rait-09.github.io/obsidian-agent-client/usage/embeddable-blocks.html).
- Chat: `type: chat`, `agent`, `model`, `height`, `id` + `persist: true` to survive restarts, `noteContext: hosting` to pin the mention to the hosting note.
- Button: `type: button`, `text`, `prompt`, `viewType: right-pane | floating | editor-tab | embedded`. Use `autoSend: false` to prepare a prompt for review before a separate send action.

## Settings worth setting
- Export: folder `Meta/Agent Chats` (pre-set), tag `agent-client`, auto-export off. Exported chats contain whatever notes were mentioned, so they show up in vault search like any note.
- Prompt injection: leave on (wikilinks, `$math$`, tables in Obsidian flavour).
- Permissions: leave auto-allow off.

## Security notes for the community template
- Desktop only. The agent has the same access as your terminal user; the plugin only surfaces approvals.
- Machine-specific paths and API keys live in Obsidian's settings and Keychain, never in the vault. The template ships a minimal `agent-client/data.json` (auto-allow off, default agent, export folder) with no sessions, paths, or keys; `build_template.py` strips the rest.
- What leaves your machine is what you send: your messages, mentioned notes, attachments. Journal notes mentioned in a chat go to the model provider.
