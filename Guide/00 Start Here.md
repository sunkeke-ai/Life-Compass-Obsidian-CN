This vault is a from-scratch template of everything Mike Schmitz describes in **"How I Run My Whole Life Out of Obsidian"** (Practical PKM, 26 Jun 2026): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h7ZAuuNDLE. Independent implementation; see `CREDITS.md`.

New here? Open [[Setup]] first. It has the status checklist and the day-1, week-1, month-1 plan. This page is the map.

Seven workflows, one vault, dashboards on top:

## Layering rule
Everything shown took the original author five years. Pick one workflow, probably the daily journaling, get it working for 30 days, then layer the next one. [[Setup]] enforces that order.

## Maintainers
Releases are built with `scripts/build_template.py` and gated by `scripts/verify_template.py`; see `scripts/RELEASE.md`.
