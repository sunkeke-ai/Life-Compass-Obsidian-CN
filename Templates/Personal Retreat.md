> Name this note `YYYY-QN Personal Retreat` (for example `2026-Q3 Personal Retreat`). The Compass dashboard finds this quarter's retreat by that naming convention and renders the wheel of life from the `wheel_*` properties above. No code changes needed.

Previous retreat: [[02 Retreats/<% moment(tp.file.title.slice(0, 7), "YYYY-[Q]Q").subtract(1, "quarter").format("YYYY-[Q]Q") %> Personal Retreat]] · Quarter note: [[01 Journal/Quarterly/<% tp.file.title.slice(0, 7) %>]] · Same quarter last year: [[02 Retreats/<% moment(tp.file.title.slice(0, 7), "YYYY-[Q]Q").subtract(1, "year").format("YYYY-[Q]Q") %> Personal Retreat]]

Block a full day. You do not need a cabin in the woods: a few hours, this one document, and the willingness to answer the hard questions.

```agent

## 1. Review life theme and core values
Do they still resonate? Edit the source notes if not.

Notes:

## 2. Review the journal
Read the last 90 days of daily notes. Look for trends in the effort scores and for what you kept writing about.
```dataviewjs
const q = moment(dv.current().quarter, "YYYY-[Q]Q");
await dv.view("Meta/views/dailyquestions", { from: q.clone().startOf("quarter").format("YYYY-MM-DD"), to: q.clone().endOf("quarter").format("YYYY-MM-DD") });
```
```dataviewjs
await dv.view("Meta/views/habits", { days: 28 });
```
Wins this quarter:
```dataviewjs
const q = moment(dv.current().quarter, "YYYY-[Q]Q");
const from = q.clone().startOf("quarter"), to = q.clone().endOf("quarter");
const cfg = dv.page("Meta/Compass Config") || {};
const pages = dv.pages(`"${cfg.daily_folder || "01 Journal/Daily"}"`).where(p => /^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/.test(p.file.name) && moment(p.file.name).isBetween(from, to, "day", "[]")).sort(p => p.file.name);
const wins = [];
for (const p of pages) for (const L of p.file.lists) if (L.section && L.section.subpath === "今日成就") wins.push(`${p.file.link}: ${L.text}`);
if (wins.length) dv.list(wins); else dv.paragraph("*No wins logged this quarter.*");
```

## 3. Wheel of life
Rate your current happiness with each area 1 to 10 in the properties at the top. Then pick ONE area that gets attention for the next 90 days.
```dataviewjs
await dv.view("Meta/views/wheel", { page: dv.current().file.path });
```
Focus area for the next 90 days:
